1.  ReplicaSet

    1. Faster Pod creation and deletion
    2. Enables self-healing
    3. Supports Manual and Auto-scaling (HPA)
    4. While Scaling UP, replica-set creates multiple pods in parallel.

2.  StatefulSet

    1. Slower Pod creation and deletion than Other sets
    2. Pod creation is always in SEQUENCE.
    3. Each POD retains it's name after self-heal


3.  DaemonSet

    1. Doesnot Support Auto-scaling
    2. Scaling is linked to Node-scaling.
